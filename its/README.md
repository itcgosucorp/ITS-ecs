# Create ITS schema

This directory contains a full ITS schema of using the ECS tools to manage your
project's index template (or your Beats field definitions) with the ECS tools.

The `fields` and `schemas` directory contains files managed by the ITS, whereas
the `generated` directory contains the files generated by running the following
command from the **root** of the ITS-ECS repository:

```bash
bash its/index-templates/<index-temaplate-name>/scripts/generator.sh
```

Refer back to [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md) for the documentation on each of generate command flags and you can write your own.

### IMPORTANT
- If you want to use your custom schema in another custom schema, you must set `reusable.order` to `1` and `reusable.expected.at` to **schema name**.

#### NOTE
- If you customize ECS schema in `schemas` directory, you should comment that by `<ITS_CUSTOM>...your custom...</ITS_CUSTOM>`
