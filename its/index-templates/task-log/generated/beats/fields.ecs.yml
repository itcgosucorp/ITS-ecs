    description: 'Date/time when the event originated.

      This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
      the event was generated by the source.

      If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
      by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

      Required field for all events.'

    description: 'The event fields are used for context information about the log
      or metric event itself.

      A log is defined as an event containing details of something that happened.
      Log events must include the time at which the thing happened. Examples of log
      events include a process starting on a host, a network packet being sent from
      a source to a destination, or a network connection between a client and a server
      being initiated or closed. A metric is defined as an event containing one or
      more numerical measurements and the time at which the measurement was taken.
      Examples of metric events include memory pressure measured on a host and device
      temperature. See the `event.kind` definition in this section for additional
      details about metric and state events.'
